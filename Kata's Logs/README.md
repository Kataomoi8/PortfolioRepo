Kata's Logs:
This is a small project I worked on when I was playing the game Chroma Chronicles on steam.
I made this for when I was streaming so there was a fun element that was happening on stream.
The general idea of it is that it grabs data from text files then populates that onto the console and then the viewers can see it on stream!
